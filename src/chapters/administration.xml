    <para>Users, connections, and active sessions can be administered from within the web interface
        if the underlying authentication module supports this. The only officially-supported
        authentication modules supporting this are the MySQL and PostgreSQL extensions, which are
        documented in <xref linkend="jdbc-auth"/>.</para>
    <para>If you are using the default authentication mechanism, or another authentication
        extension, this chapter probably does not apply to you, and the management options will not
        be visible in the Guacamole interface. If, on the other hand, you are using one of the
        database authentication providers, and you are logged in as a user with sufficient
        privileges, you will see management sections listed within the settings screen:</para>

        <para>Clicking "Active Sessions" navigates to the session management screen. The session
            management screen displays all active sessions and allows system administrators to kill
            them as needed.</para>
        <para>When any user accesses a particular remote desktop connection, a unique session is
            created and will appear in the list of active sessions in the session management screen.
            Each active session is displayed in a sortable table, showing the corresponding user's
            username, how long the session has been active, the IP address of the machine from which
            the user is connecting, and the name of the connection being used.</para>

            <para>The table can be resorted by clicking on the column headers. Clicking any column
                will resort the table by the values within that column, while clicking a column
                which is already sorted will toggle between ascending and descending order.</para>
            <para>The content of the table can be limited through search terms specified in the
                "Filter" field. Entering search terms will limit the table to only sessions
                containing those terms. For example, to list only connections by the user
                "guacadmin" which have been active since March, 2015, you would enter: "guacadmin
                2015-03". Beware that if a search term needs to contain spaces, it must be enclosed
                in double quotes to avoid being interpreted as multiple terms.</para>

                block in standard CIDR notation, such "10.0.0.0/8" or "2001:db8:1234::/48". This

            <para>Initially, the connection history table will display only the most recent history
                records. You can page through these records to see how and when Guacamole has been
                used.</para>
            <para>Just as with the table of active sessions described earlier, the table of history
                records can be resorted by clicking on the column headers or filtered by entering
                search terms within the "Filter" field.</para>
            <para>The same filtering format applies - a search term containing spaces must be
                enclosed in double quotes to avoid being interpreted as multiple terms, and only
                history records which contain each term will be included in the history table.
                Unlike the table of active sessions, however, the filter will only take effect once
                you click the "Search" button. This is due to the nature of the connection history,
                as the number of records may be quite extensive.</para>

            be changed at next login), add or remove administrative permissions, and add or remove
            read access to specific connections or groups. If you are managing a large number of
            connections or groups and wish to reduce the size of the list displayed, you can do so
            by specifying search terms within the "Filter" field. Groups will be filtered by name
            and connections will be filtered by name or protocol.</para>
        <para>If you have delete permission on the user, you will also see a "Delete" button.
            Clicking this button will permanently delete the user. Alternatively, if you only wish

            effect while not removing the user entirely. If they attempt to log in, the attempt will

            <title>Connection organization and balancing</title>
            <para>Connection groups can be either "organizational" or "balancing". Each group can
                contain any number of other connections or groups, but the semantics of the group
                change depending on the type.</para>
            <para>An organizational group behaves exactly as a folder or directory in a file system.
                It simply contains connections and other groups, but provides no other behavior.
                Clicking on an organizational group within a connection list will expand the group,
                revealing its contents.</para>
            <para>A balancing group behaves as a connection. It dynamically balances load across the
                connections it contains, choosing the connection with the fewest number of active
                users. Unlike organizational groups, clicking on a balancing group causes a new
                connection to be opened. The actual underlying connection used depends on which
                connection has the least load at the time the group was clicked, and whether session
                affinity is enabled on that group.</para>

                    <primary>session affinity</primary>
                </indexterm>Enabling session affinity for a balancing group ensures that users are
                consistently routed to the same underlying connections until they log out of
                Guacamole. The load balancing behavior of the balancing group will apply only for
                the first time a particular user connects to the group. If your users may lose their
                desktop state if they are routed to a different underlying connection, this option
                should be enabled.</para>
