    <title>Using Guacamole</title>
    <para><indexterm>

        </indexterm>Guacamole provides access to much of the functionality of a desktop from within
        your web browser. Although most people use remote desktop tools only when absolutely
        necessary, we believe that Guacamole must be aimed at becoming a primary means of accessing
        desktops, and the interface is thus intended to be as seamless and unobtrusive as
        possible.</para>
    <section xml:id="home-screen">
        <title>Home screen</title>
        <para>Once you have successfully logged in, you will be taken to either the Guacamole home
            screen, where all available connections are listed, or directly to a connection, if you
            only have access to one connection.</para>
        <para>The home screen will contain a list of all connections to which you have access, along
            with thumbnails of any recently used or active connections. If you have access to a
            large number of connections and wish to quickly locate a specific connection, you can
            also enter search terms within the "Filter" field to filter the list of connections by
            name.</para>

        <para>Clicking on any connection will open that connection within the current window or tab,
            but multiple connections can be used simultaneously. You can easily navigate back to the
            home screen without disconnecting by using your browsers back button or the "Home"
            button in the Guacamole menu. Each connection you use will remain active until
            explicitly disconnected, or until you navigate away from Guacamole entirely. Active
            connections can be seen as thumbnails updating in real-time on the home screen.</para>

            <para>With the exception of the client screen discussed below, all Guacamole screens
                contain a menu in the upper-right corner called the "user menu". This menu displays
                your username and contains several options which depend on your user's level of

            </keycombo>, for example) or by the web browser. If you press one of these reserved
            combinations, the effect will be observed locally, not remotely, and the remote desktop
            will receive only some of the keys.</para>
        <para>Guacamole provides its own, built-in on-screen keyboard which allows keys to be sent
            to the remote desktop without affecting the local system. If the device you're using
            does not have certain keys which the remote desktop depends on, such as the arrow keys
            or <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>, you can use the on-screen keyboard for this, too. You can show
            the on-screen keyboard by selecting the "On-screen keyboard" option from the
            menu.</para>
        <para>Clicking (or tapping) the buttons of the on-screen keyboard has the same effect as
            pressing the same buttons on a real keyboard, except that the operating system and
            browser will not intercept these keypresses; they will only be sent to the remote
            desktop.</para>

        <para><indexterm>
                <primary>zoom</primary>
            </indexterm>Guacamole will default to shrinking or expanding the remote display to fit
            the browser window exactly, but this is not necessarily ideal. If the remote display is
            much larger than your local display, the screen may be impossible to see or interact
            with. This is especially true for mobile phones, whose screens need to be small enough
            to fit in the average hand.</para>
        <para>You can scale the display on touch devices by using the familiar pinch gesture. Place
            two fingers on the screen and bring them closer together to zoom out or further apart to
            zoom in.</para>
        <para>If your device lacks a touch screen, you can also control the zoom level through the
            menu. The controls for zooming in and out are located at the bottom of the menu. The
            current zoom level is displayed between two "-" and "+" buttons which control the zoom
            level in 10% increments.</para>

    <section xml:id="touch-devices">
        <title>Mobile or touch devices</title>
        <para>Guacamole is designed to work equally well across all HTML5 browsers, including those
            of mobile devices. It will automatically handle input from a touch screen or a
            traditional mouse (or both, if you happen to have such a gifted computer), and provides
            alternative input methods for devices which lack a physical keyboard.</para>
        <section xml:id="touch-mouse">
            <title>Mouse emulation</title>
            <para><indexterm>
                    <primary>mouse</primary>
                </indexterm>In the case that your device has a touchscreen and lacks a mouse,
                Guacamole will emulate a mouse for the sake of interacting with remote desktops that
                expect mouse input. By default, Guacamole uses "absolute" mouse emulation. This
                means that the mouse pointer is positioned at the location of each tap on the
                screen.</para>
            <para>In both absolute and relative modes, you can click-and-drag by tapping the screen
                and then quickly placing your finger back down. This gesture only causes the mouse
                button to press down, but does not release it again until you lift your finger back
                up.</para>
            <section xml:id="absolute-mouse-emulation">
                <title>Absolute mode (touchscreen)</title>
                <para>Absolute mouse emulation is the default as it tends to be what people expect
                    when using a touch device to interact with applications designed for mouse
                    input.</para>
                <para>Each tap on the screen is translated into a left-click at that position.
                    Right-clicking is accomplished through pressing and holding your finger on the
                    screen. If parts of the remote display are off-screen, you can drag your finger
                    around the screen to pan the off-screen parts back into view.</para>
                <para>Although absolute mouse emulation works generally well, a finger makes for a
                    very inaccurate pointing device. To address this, Guacamole also provides
                    "relative" mouse emulation. Relative mouse emulation provides a way to deal with
                    the need for accurate pointer control, when a true pointer device is not
                    present.</para>

                <title>Relative mode (touchpad)</title>
                <para>Guacamole's relative mouse emulation behaves similarly to the touchpad present
                    on most modern laptops. You drag your finger across the display to move the
                    mouse pointer, and tap the display to left-click. The pointer moves relative to
                    the motion of your finger. Right-clicking is accomplished with a two-finger tap,
                    and middle-clicking with a three-finger tap. The mouse scroll wheel can be
                    operated by dragging two fingers up or down.</para>
                <para>Because the relative mouse emulation reserves so many gestures for the
                    different mouse buttons and actions, common touch gestures like panning and
                    pinch-to-zoom will not work while relative mouse emulation is enabled. Instead,
                    the screen will automatically pan to keep the mouse pointer in view, and you can
                    zoom through the buttons in the menu.</para>

            <title>Typing without a physical keyboard</title>
            <para>Many mobile devices lack a physical keyboard entirely, and instead provide their
                own on-screen keyboards. As these are not true keyboards per se and do not produce
                key presses, Guacamole's text input mode is required for typing on these
                platforms.</para>
            <para>"Text input" allows input of keystrokes based on the input of text. Choosing "Text
                input" tells Guacamole to infer keystrokes by tracking text entered, rather than
                relying on actual key presses. Guacamole will instead determine the combination of
                keypresses necessary to produce the same pattern of input, including
                deletions.</para>
            <para><indexterm>
                    <primary>input method editors</primary>
                </indexterm>If you wish to type via an IME (input method editor), such as those
                required for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, text input mode is required for this as
                well. Such IMEs function through the explicit insertion of text and do not send
                traditional key presses. Using text input mode within Guacamole thus allows you to
                use a locally-installed IME, without requiring the IME to be installed on the remote
                desktop.</para>

            change the language of the Guacamole interface, to change the default input method used
            by Guacamole connections, and to change the default mouse emulation mode for if a touch
            device is used. If you have sufficient permissions, you may also change your password,

                use. If this fails, or the browser is using a language not yet available within

                others are aimed mainly at traditional desktop use. By default, Guacamole will use
                the keyboard and mouse modes most commonly preferred by users, but you can change
