    <para>The server "nop" instruction does absolutely nothing, has no parameters, and is
        universally ignored by Guacamole clients. Its main use is as a keep-alive signal, and may be
        sent by guacd or client plugins when there is no activity to ensure the socket is not closed
        due to timeout.</para>
