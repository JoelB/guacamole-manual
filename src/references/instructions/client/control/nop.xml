    <para>The client "nop" instruction does absolutely nothing, has no parameters, and is
        universally ignored by the Guacamole server. Its main use is as a keep-alive signal, and may
        be sent by Guacamole clients when there is no activity to ensure the socket is not closed
        due to timeout.</para>
