    <para>Requests that the connection be made using the specified protocol, or to the specified
        existing connection. Whether a new connection is established or an existing connection is
        joined depends on whether the ID of an active connection is provided. The Guacamole protocol
        dictates that the IDs generated for active connections (provided during the handshake of
        those connections via the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
            linkend="ready-instruction">ready instruction</link>) must not collide with any
        supported protocols.</para>
    <para>This is the first instruction sent during the handshake phase.</para>
